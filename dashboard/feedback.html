We were looking at a few different options with him and he was very patient and accommodating with our situation. Jon was very quick with any questions we had and made choosing the perfect car very easy. We will definitely be working with him in the future.</p>

                    <p>I’ve purchased many cars over the years - Jon is by far the easiest and most knowledgeable person to work with. His passion is the car industry and it shows - he doesn’t mess around with cars that have any red flags or cut corners when it comes to selling high quality, solid cars at a good price. I felt he had my best interests in mind, wasn’t pushy or aggressive whatsoever. Highly recommend working with Jon to buy your next vehicle!</p>
